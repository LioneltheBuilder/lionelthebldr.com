# How To Break Into Tech With Coding? A Practical Guide

Thinking about tech but not sure where to start? This guide was created to help you take those first steps into coding and, through daily struggles and persistence, eventually build a thriving career in tech.

## 1. How to Begin Learning to Code

- **Start with HTML and CSS**: Before diving deep, it's crucial to understand the basics. Platforms like freeCodeCamp offer quick, comprehensive courses on HTML and CSS. These skills are foundational, allowing you to understand the structure and style of websites.

- **Familiarize Yourself with Key Terms**: As you learn, you'll become comfortable with the terminology and functionality of various technologies, which is key for building your code understanding.

## 2. Advancing to JavaScript and Frameworks

- **JavaScript Basics**: Once you've grasped HTML and CSS, JavaScript is your next step. It's the backbone of most of today’s web applications. Once you learn how to build things, you can quickly pick up the syntax of any language by solving problems as they arise.

- **Explore React**: Learning React will help you build efficient and scalable user interfaces. It's one of the top frameworks for web development and will significantly enhance your skill set, especially when learning about the Virtual DOM and building components.

## 3. Building Projects and Portfolio

- **Practical Experience**: Apply your skills by working on hands-on projects. If you're struggling to come up with an original idea, start simple with a personal portfolio website.

- **Showcase Your Work**: Use your portfolio to display your projects. This is crucial for networking and building a personal brand, which ties into job applications later on.

## 4. Specializing and Job Hunting

- **Choose Your Specialty**: After building a base with projects, decide on a specialty—whether it’s back-end, front-end, or full-stack development.

- **Freelancing and Side Projects**: Gain experience and build credibility through freelancing and personal projects.

## 5. Essential Skills and Resources

- **Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking**: Continue to develop these essential skills throughout your learning journey.

- **Learning Platforms**: Besides freeCodeCamp, explore other resources and coding communities like Codecademy.

## 6. Joining the Community and Networking

- **Community Engagement**: Join developer communities like The Digital Builders to participate in challenges and discussions.

- **Networking Tips**: Attend tech meetups and conferences, and connect with professionals online.

## 7. Navigating Job Applications and Interviews

- **Resume Tips**: Take your time to craft and continually evolve a tech resume that highlights your projects and skills.

- **Interview Preparation**: Familiarize yourself with common interview questions, practice on platforms like LeetCode, and be prepared to discuss your projects and technical challenges you've overcome.
