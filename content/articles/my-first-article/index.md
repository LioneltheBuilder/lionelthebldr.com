# My Journey: From Freelance Photography to Software Engineering

Hello and welcome to my first blog post! Today, I want to share with you my personal journey - a path that took unexpected turns, from freelance photography and video work to driving trucks, and finally to where I am now: a software engineer at a startup working on an exciting project called Washington's Hammer.

## The Early Days: Capturing Moments

My professional career began in the creative field of photography and videography. I freelanced, capturing moments and telling stories through my lens. This experience was not just about the art; it taught me the fundamentals of running a business, client communication, and the importance of adapting to new challenges.

## A Shift in Gears: Truck Driving for Family Stability

Life, however, had other plans. With the news of my son's arrival, I pivoted to a more stable and lucrative career to ensure I could provide for my growing family. I obtained my CDL and started a journey as a truck driver. Those days on the road were a mix of adventure and contemplation. It was during these long drives that I realized the need for more - a career that not only provided for my family but also fulfilled my intellectual curiosity.

## The Turn to Tech: Self-Taught Coding Path

That's when coding entered my life. I've always had a penchant for technology and problem-solving, and coding seemed like a natural fit. With the help of YouTube tutorials, free online courses, and a relentless dedication, I taught myself how to code. This wasn't easy. Balancing family life, a full-time job, and learning a completely new skill required discipline and sacrifice, but it was a challenge I was ready to embrace.

## Freelancing in Tech: Building a New Portfolio

As my coding skills strengthened, I began freelancing again, but this time in a different realm - web development. I worked on projects for authors and small businesses, helping them establish an online presence. This phase was crucial; it was real-world experience, building applications and websites, solving real problems, and learning the ropes of web development.

## Joining Washington's Hammer: A Leap into Software Engineering

Eventually, my journey led me to an opportunity with Washington's Hammer - a navy project management software tool. This role as a software engineer has been a significant milestone in my career. Here, I am not just coding; I am part of a team that's making a tangible impact, improving project management in the naval sphere.

## Reflections and Looking Ahead

Looking back, each phase of my career has been a building block, shaping me into who I am today - a software engineer with a diverse background and a unique perspective. My journey underscores the belief that it's never too late to change paths or to pursue your passions.

As I continue in this exciting phase of my career, I look forward to sharing insights, experiences, and learnings with you through this blog. Whether you're someone considering a career shift, a fellow coder, or just curious about the world of tech, I hope my story inspires you to chase your dreams, no matter the obstacles.

Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for more stories and insights from the world of software engineering!
